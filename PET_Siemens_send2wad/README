Based on python2 code taken from the WAD_Python repository on github:   
  https://github.com/wadqc/WAD_Python/tree/master/Tools/PET_Siemens_send2wad
Converted to python3
  
This tool converts XML files into a dicom file and sends them to the wadqc server for processing.   
Should be used in conjunction with the PT_BiographParser module.

USE AT OWN RISK!

This folder contains the source code for the processing of PETQC reports generated by Siemens Biograph PET CT scanners.   
The executable has to be installed on the system (AT YOUR OWN RISK!!) and the configuration file has to be appropriately configured.

- An executable is currently not (yet) provided
